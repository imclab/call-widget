# Call Widget

The call widget is a Javascript tool which allows developers to easily embed access to our [call congress tool](https://github.com/tfrce/call-congress). 

## Getting Started

```
<form></form>
<script></script>
```

Simply copy and paste that where you would alike your form to appear. Make sure the **ids** are set but feel free to change the structure of the HTML/CSS to match your websites design.

You can view a basic example of the form on our [example.html](http://tfrce.github.io/call-widget/example/example.html).

## Direct API Access

You don't need to use our Javascript and can view the [full documentation](http://github.com/tfrce/call-congress) of the call-congress API or even run up your own call-congress server.
